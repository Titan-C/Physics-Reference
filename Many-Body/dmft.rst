.. DMFT

===========================
Dynamical Mean Field Theory
===========================

The DMFT has a generalized "Weiss function", a function of time instead of a
single number. It takes account local quantum fluctuations. The mean field is
the bare Green's function for the local effective action. It is not the non
interacting Green's function of the original lattice.
