Grassmann Algebra
=================

The algebra of anticommuting numbers is summarized to its essential properties.
A Grassmann algebra is defined by a set of generators denoted by $\{\xi_\alpha\}$,
with $\alpha=1,\cdots,n$. These generators anticommute:

.. math::
  \xi_\alpha \xi_\beta + \xi_\beta \xi_\alpha = 0

so in particular:

.. math::
  \xi_\alpha^2 = 0
